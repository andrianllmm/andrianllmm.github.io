It is an <a href="https://github.com/andrianllmm/tagalog-stemmer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> project and is available as a python library. aklstemmer was first developed as a supplementary tool for the the <a href="/projects/taglid">TagLID project</a>. The main purpose of the library is to determine the base or root word of a Tagalog word. It was specifically developed to improve the dictionary-base Language Identification tool since inflected words is often not included in the word list. It is now a reusable tool for stemming any Tagalog-inflected words.</p> </body></html>
