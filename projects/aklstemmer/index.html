It is an <a href="https://github.com/andrianllmm/aklanon-stemmer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> project and is available as a python library. aklstemmer was first developed as a supplementary tool for the spellchecker used in the <a href="/projects/aklish">Aklish project</a>. The main purpose of the library is to determine the base or root word of an Aklanon word. It was specifically developed to improve the dictionary-base spellchecker since inflected words is often not included in the word list. It is now a reusable tool for stemming any Aklanon-inflected words.</p> </body></html>
