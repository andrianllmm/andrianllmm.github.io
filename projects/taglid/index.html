It is an <a href="https://github.com/andrianllmm/taglid" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> project and is available as a python library. TagLID was first developed as a data analysis tool for our <a href="/publications/#maagma2023taglish">Practical Research 2</a> in my Senior High School. The main purpose of the library is to identify the language of a text as either Tagalog or English. It was specifically developed to evaluate the frequency values of Tagalog and English words in a Taglish text. This was needed for our study since we need to determine the relative frequency of Taglish in a large dataset of text from our respondents. However, it grew as a reusable tool for language detection.</p> </body></html>
