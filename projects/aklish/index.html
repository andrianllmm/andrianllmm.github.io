<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Iâ€™m excited to introduce <a href="https://aklish.up.railway.app" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aklish</a>, a web application designed to facilitate the crowdsourcing of Aklanon-English translations. It is an <a href="https://github.com/andrianllmm/aklish" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> project and is deployed in <a href="https://aklish.up.railway.app" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Railway</a> for demo purposes (it may be unavailable due to hosting costs). Aklish was initially developed as a <a href="/publications/#maagma2024aklish">Research Capstone Project</a> during my Senior High School. The main purpose of the app is to enrich the Aklanon language, my mother tongue, which is classified as a Low-resource Language (LRL). It was specifically developed to offer a collaborative platform where users can contribute and manage translations between Aklanon and English. Over time, the app has grown to include additional features such as Aklanon-English dictionaries, spellcheckers, and word games.</p> <div class="m-2 d-flex justify-content-center"> <img src="/assets/img/project_preview/aklish.png" alt="project thumbnail" style="width: 100%; height: auto"> </div> </body></html>
