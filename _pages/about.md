I have a keen interest in **web development**, **natural language processing**, UI/UX design, and data science. Iâ€™ve developed my skills through <u>developing</u> applications, <u>leading</u> design projects, and <u>conducting</u> research.

I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage technical skills and problem-solving abilities in a dynamic internship environment.
