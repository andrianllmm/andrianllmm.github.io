Hello world, this is **Andrian**, a Computer Science undergraduate at [University of the Philippines Visayas](https://www.upv.edu.ph/).

I have a keen interest in full-stack web development, UI/UX design, data science, and natural language processing. Iâ€™ve developed my skills through developing and managing web applications, leading design projects, and conducting research.

I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage technical skills and problem-solving abilities in a dynamic internship environment.

When I'm away from the keyboard, I enjoy graphic design, playing chess, and strumming the guitar.
