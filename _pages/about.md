Welcome to my digital space!

I'm **Andrian**, a dedicated 1st-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at the [University of the Philippines Visayas](https://www.upv.edu.ph/).

I’m passionate about full-stack web development, UI/UX design, data science, and natural language processing. I’ve developed my skills through a variety of projects and research, applying technical knowledge to real-world problems.

When I'm away from the keyboard, I enjoy graphic design, playing chess, and strumming the guitar.
