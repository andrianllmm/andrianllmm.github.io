I'm thrilled to present [Taglid](https://github.com/andrianllmm/taglid), a word level Language Identification (LID) tool for Tagalog-English (Taglish) text. It is an [open source](https://github.com/andrianllmm/taglid) project and is available as a python library. TagLID was first developed as a data analysis tool for our [Practical Research 2](/publications/#maagma2023taglish) in my Senior High School. The main purpose of the library is to identify the language of a text as either Tagalog or English. It was specifically developed to evaluate the frequency values of Tagalog and English words in a Taglish text. This was needed for our study since we need to determine the relative frequency of Taglish in a large dataset of text from our respondents. However, it grew as a reusable tool for language detection.
