  <h2>The Brief</h2>

  <p>
    The <strong>Supreme Secondary Learner Government (SSLG)</strong> at Maloco National High School (MNHS) is a co-curricular, learner-led organization responsible for executing and overseeing various programs, projects, and activities within the school. Currently, the SSLG lacks a cohesive brand identity, including consistent logos and other assets. To align with the established branding of MNHS, the school's existing colors, fonts, and the like will be retained while introducing new, distinct logos for the SSLG. These new logos will be implemented in all SSLG materials moving forward.

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <p>
    The primary challenge was to create a logo that aligns with MNHSâ€™s established brand while introducing a fresh identity that subtly incorporates elements of SSLG's core values.

    Inspired by the concept of resiliency and innovation central to SSLG's roles, the new logo features an abstract figure composed of a raised fist and a light bulb, each reflecting the themes respectively. With this new logomark, the wordmark, emblem, and other assets was formed.
