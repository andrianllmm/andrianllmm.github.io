I'm thrilled to present [aklstemmer](https://github.com/andrianllmm/aklanon-stemmer), a Python library for Aklanon word stemming. It is an [open source](https://github.com/andrianllmm/aklanon-stemmer) project and is available as a python library. aklstemmer was first developed as a supplementary tool for the spellchecker used in the [Aklish project](/projects/aklish). The main purpose of the library is to determine the base or root word of an Aklanon word. It was specifically developed to improve the dictionary-base spellchecker since inflected words is often not included in the word list. It is now a reusable tool for stemming any Aklanon-inflected words.
