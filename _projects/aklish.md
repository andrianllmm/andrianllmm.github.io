[Aklish](https://aklish.up.railway.app) is a web application designed to facilitate the crowdsourcing of Aklanon-English translations. It is an [open source](https://github.com/andrianllmm/aklish) project and is deployed in [Railway](https://aklish.up.railway.app) for demo purposes (it may be unavailable due to hosting costs). Aklish was initially developed as a [Research Capstone Project](/publications/#maagma2024aklish) during my Senior High School. The main purpose of the app is to enrich the Aklanon language, my mother tongue, which is classified as a Low-resource Language (LRL). It was specifically developed to offer a collaborative platform where users can contribute and manage translations between Aklanon and English. Over time, the app has grown to include additional features such as Aklanon-English dictionaries, spellcheckers, and word games.
