I'm excited to introduce [tglstemmer](https://github.com/andrianllmm/tagalog-stemmer), a Python library for Tagalog word stemming. It is an [open source](https://github.com/andrianllmm/tagalog-stemmer) project and is available as a python library. aklstemmer was first developed as a supplementary tool for the the [TagLID project](/projects/taglid). The main purpose of the library is to determine the base or root word of a Tagalog word. It was specifically developed to improve the dictionary-base Language Identification tool since inflected words is often not included in the word list. It is now a reusable tool for stemming any Tagalog-inflected words.
