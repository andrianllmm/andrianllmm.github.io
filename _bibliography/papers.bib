  abstract = {The present study aims to develop and evaluate a web application for crowdsourcing Aklanon-English translations named “Aklish” by utilizing a quantitative research design. The respondents of the study were 34 Grade 11 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students. To evaluate the effectiveness of Aklish, the functionality, performance, accessibility, adherence to modern standards (AMS), search engine optimization (SEO), usability, and engagement of Aklish is measured by the researchers using the research instruments System Functionality Scale (SFS), Lighthouse, System Usability Scale (SUS), and Engagement Metrics, respectively. Based on the results, Aklish is determined to be functional (82.01%), perform well (81.33%), be accessible (96.79%), adhere to modern standards (100%), be search engine optimized (99.21%), be usable (61.29%), and relatively low in engagement based on several metrics. This suggests that while Aklish demonstrates remarkable functionality, accessibility, AMS, and SEO, there is room for improving its usability and engagement. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted aspects of a web application like Aklish, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.},

  title = {Correlation Between the Level of Language Dominance and the Relative Frequency of Taglish Code-Switching of Science, Technology, and Engineering Students},
  year = {2023},
  school = {Maloco National High School},
  note = {Conducted for Practical Research 2},
  abstract = {The present study investigates the relationship between the level of language dominance and the relative frequency of Tagalog-English (Taglish) code-switching (CS) by utilizing a quantitative correlational research design. The respondents of the study were 57 multilingual Science, Technology, And Engineering (STE) students. The researchers used two research instruments, the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) and the Comic Elicitation Task (CET), to measure the variables respectively. Based on the results determined by utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient and t-test, there is no significant relationship between the variables (r (55)=0.19,p>0.05). This suggests that CS frequency is not an indirect indicator of language dominance. It indicates that language choice in individual instances may not reflect overall language ability. However, further investigation is needed to explore why this is the case. By highlighting its relationship with language dominance, this study contributes to the understanding of CS behaviors of multilingual individuals.},

  note = {Conducted for Regional SciMathlympics},
  abstract = {This mathematical investigation examined the number of right isosceles triangles that can be formed in an nxn-size grid based on a dissection puzzle called tangrams. By carefully analyzing triangle formation patterns and the conditions that govern them on a 1x1 to 9x9 tangram grid, the researchers have determined that only right isosceles triangles can be formed, which varies in size, orientation, and position. They further identified two types of right isosceles triangles, distinguished by where the hypotenuse coincides. These observations have led to a conjecture with four main components, two of which were proven by Mathematical Induction, while the remaining require further investigation. Despite its limitations, this study provides a foundation for future research on tangrams, puzzles, and related mathematical concepts.},
